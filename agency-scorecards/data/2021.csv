The interdependency and collaboration among the Small Business Program, agency acquisition staff, and program offices on acquisition planning and market research activities was critical to NRC’s achievements.  Moving forward, the Small Business Program plans to enhance performance where possible through leveraging innovative technologies that foster collaboration, continuing the virtual series of small business events designed to educate the business community on how to conduct business with the agency, implementing strategic corrective actions to improve subcontracting performance, and removing barriers associated with participating in the agency’s acquisition program."

For subcontracting plans associated with an individual VA-administered contract, VA excels consistently. For example, in FY 2021, VA achieved 23.9% small business participation on individual plans, well above VA’s 16% goal. When these results were combined with commercial plans, where Government-wide policy provides limited management or oversight, VA achieved 13.2% for all small businesses.

With respect to prime contracting, VA’s hierarchy of contracting preferences, established by law, mandates VA consider Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses (SDVOSBs) and Veteran-Owned Small Businesses (VOSBs) prior to other small business preferences such as those available in the HUBZone, 8(a) or Women-Owned Small Business programs. While consistent with VA’s mission to serve Veterans, this mandate necessarily makes achievement of those other goals extremely challenging.

VA also has special authority to award contracts to VOSBs. VA achieved 24.2% compared to a 17% goal in FY 2021. Because the Scorecard evaluates agency performance on the Government-wide small business programs, it does not factor in this VA-specific accomplishment. However, in FY 2021 VA put nearly $8.4 billion into the hands of Veteran entrepreneurs and owners."

In addition, in FY 2021, EPA for the first time exceeded all of the socioeconomic business statutory goals, awarding the highest percentages of dollars in more than a decade in all but one of the small and socioeconomic business categories. These achievements were due in part to the Agency’s efforts in conducting cutting-edge acquisition planning and market research.

It is our commitment to foster an environment to assist small businesses with technical assistance and capacity building activities. In FY2022, the Department will enhance procurement forecast capabilities and augment the delivery of trainings, outreach activities, capacity building and technical assistance to small and minority business owners. The Department will work closely with acquisition workforce and prime contractors on strategies to meet small business subcontracting goals."

HUD effectively achieved, and exceeded, that goal by obligating 28% of its contract dollars to small business primes. Normally, this would have earned HUD an “A+” grade on SBA’s Small Business Procurement Scorecard.
Alongside small business procurement, HUD has a key goal of improving its financial performance. In FY 2021, HUD continued to undertake a massive effort to de-obligate prior year funding from expired contracts to reconcile a long-standing financial management challenge and achieve a clean audit opinion.
These de-obligations have impacted HUD’s grade. HUD’s de-obligation of prior year funds has caused the percentage of obligated dollars going to small business primes to significantly decrease from 28% to negative 6.18% within SBA’s scorecard grade calculation methodology. The de-obligations are subtracted from current year funding achievements (regardless of when those funds were first obligated). As such, HUD reported a negative $15.4m in Service-Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business obligations which resulted in a negative 1.57% utilization rate. It is crucial to note that, when excluding these de-obligations of prior year funds, HUD obligated $49 million to Service-Disabled Veteran Owned Small Businesses in FY 2021 and approximately $495 million to small business prime contractors, a $21m increase from FY 2020.
HUD appreciates that SBA has been thoughtful in taking the Department’s concerns under consideration. HUD worked with SBA to highlight the impacts of those prior year de-obligations and supports SBA’s modification to the scorecard grade calculation methodology. The Federal Register notice published on June 22, 2022, sets forth SBA’s revised method for reflecting negative-dollar transactions (or “deobligations”) in the SBA scorecard starting with the Fiscal Year 2022. This change will provide a more accurate reflection of the actual opportunities for small businesses to participate in government contracts with not only HUD but all Federal agencies.
From FY 2012 to FY 2019, HUD significantly improved its Small Business Procurement Scorecard grades. HUD received consecutive “A” or “A+” grades, and in FY 2018 and FY 2019, HUD achieved all its prime small business goals. In FY 2020 and FY 2021, the Department continued to award a significant portion of its contract dollars to small business concerns. In FY 2021, HUD also surpassed the HUBZone goal for the fourth consecutive year.
HUD remains committed to continued collaborative efforts with program offices, procurement and OSDBU staff, senior leadership, and SBA to identify areas to afford small businesses maximum practicable opportunities in contracting. In addition to its robust acquisition planning processes, the Department will continue to increase its small business outreach, education, and advocacy efforts. A Procurement Action Team in support of HUD’s Equity Assessment Group, as part of HUD’s implementation of EO 13985, was established and identified strategies on expanding contracting opportunities to socially and economically disadvantaged and
underutilized small business concerns. Additionally, HUD is continuing to take corrective actions to timely de-obligate unliquidated balances and improve contract management practices."

ED has pledged to train employees on changes in acquisition policy and regulations, particularly those affecting small business utilization. Exceeding our Service-Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) and Historically Underutilized Business Zones (HUBZone) goals has remained a challenge, and we will continue to look for ways to improve our performance in these socioeconomic categories. The Department will continue to make strategic efforts to increase overall awards to small businesses, with a focus on attracting more firms in the SDVOSB and HUBZone socioeconomic programs. To that end, the Department is focusing on attending and organizing events for SDVOSB and HUBZone small businesses. Small business elements have been incorporated into the Department's Fiscal Year 2022-2026 Strategic Plan; a small business policy guide has been established; and Senior Executive Performance plans have been updated to include small business goals."

The DoD achieved an “A” rating for the eighth consecutive year due to more than $83 billion in obligations directly to small businesses, as well as another $50 billion that was subcontracted to small business from DoD’s large prime suppliers. Additionally, DoD’s Mentor Protégé Program continues to provide a robust platform for small businesses to grow as viable contributors to the defense industrial base. Diversity and equity are strategic imperatives critical to mission readiness, and DoD is committed to cultivating, and increasing access to, a more diverse and equitable industrial base. DoD will prioritize the use of the Procurement Technical Assistance Centers along with the Small Business Professionals to increase the number of small businesses in the defense industrial base.
