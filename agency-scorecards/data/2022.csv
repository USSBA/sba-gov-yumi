These contract dollars increased from $6.7 billion in FY 2021 to $21.8 billion in FY 2022, a 225% increase, and we anticipate these raw numbers will continue to rise. The FY 2022 total also represented 38.5% of VA's total procurement of $56.6 billion. Because there contracts require extensive referral networks to connect Veteran patients to community doctors, they significantly increase the share of VA's awards to large businesses. VA continues to face challenges in subcontracting due to the overwhelming dominance of commercial plans. VA consistently excels with subcontracting plans associated with an individual VA-administered contract. For example, in FY 2022, VA achieved 26.5% small business participation on individual plans, well above VA's 17.5% goal. When these results were combined with commercial plans, where Government-wide policy provides limited management or oversight, VA achieved 11.0% for all small businesses. VA also has special authority to award contracts to VOSBs. Because the Scorecard evaluates agency performance on the Government-wide small business programs, it does not factor in this VA-specific accomplishment. However, in FY 2022 VA put nearly $9.3 billion into the hands of Veteran entrepreneurs and owners."

The subcontracting program is very critical to the Agency's small business programs and there are thousands of small businesses that provide support to NASA's mission by building critical hardware components for NASA. The NASA innovative Mentor-Protege Program also continues to provide a robust platform for small busiensses to grow as viable contributors to the Agency and federal government. The NASA Office of Small Business Programs (OSBP) strategically develops outreach and training opportunities for the small business community. OSBP also works closely with the NASA Office of Procurement to identify prime and subcontracting opportunities for small businesses. OSBP maintains vigorous digital marketing engagements capabilities including its website, NASA Vendor Database, OSBP Mobile App, email marketing, social media presence, and an online calendar. These tools allow OSBP to directly and effectively engage with small businesses and execute virtual outreach events. As always, this achievement is credited to the support of NASA's senior management, the Agency's small business specialists, technical and program teams, and other Acquisition Professionals. "

This achievement was due to the collaborative efforts of the program offices, procurement and OSDBU staff, and the Department's senior leadership. To support the Administration's priority on advancing equity in federal procurement and expanding opportunities for Small Disadvantaged Businesses, HUD convened its inaugural outreach event for SDBs helping them to navigate the complex federal marketplace. Additionally, HUD conducted outreach events to help new entrants access capital and market their capabilities to federal buyers. These critical advocacy efforts build the pipeline of small businesses in the industrial base which has significantly declined over the past decade.
