continues to face challenges in subcontracting due to the overwhelming dominance of commercial plans. For subcontracting plans associated with an individual VA-administered contract, VA generally performs well. For example, in FY 2023, VA achieved 15.4% small business participation on individual plans, within 2% of VA’s 17.2% goal. When these results were combined with commercial plans, where Government-wide policy provides limited management or oversight, VA achieved 10.3% for all small businesses. With respect to prime contracting, VA’s hierarchy of contracting preferences, established by law, mandates VA consider Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses (SDVOSBs) and Veteran-Owned Small Businesses (VOSBs) prior to other small business preferences such as those available in the HUBZone, 8(a) or Women-Owned Small Business programs. While consistent with VA’s mission to serve Veterans, this mandate necessarily makes achievement of those other goals challenging. VA also has special authority to award contracts to VOSBs. VA achieved 28% compared to a 17% goal in FY 2023. Because the Scorecard evaluates agency performance on the Government-wide small business programs, it does not factor in this VA-specific accomplishment. However, in FY 2023 VA put over $10.5 billion into the hands of Veteran entrepreneurs and owners."},

Fiscal Year (FY) 2023, NASA maintained its SBA scorecard grade of an \"A\" due to more than $3.6 billion dollars in obligations directly to small businesses, as well as an additional $4 billion that was subcontracted to small businesses from NASA's large prime contractors. The subcontracting program is very critical to the Agency's small business program as NASA achieve all its small business subcontracting goals in FY 2023.  There are thousands of small businesses subcontractors that provide support to NASA's mission by building critical hardware components for NASA’s large prime contractors. The NASA Mentor-Protege Program provided a robust platform for small businesses to grow and increase their Technical Readiness Level to become viable contributors to the Agency and federal government. The NASA Office of Small Business Programs (OSBP) strategically develops outreach and training opportunities for the small business community. OSBP also works closely with the NASA Office of Procurement to identify prime and subcontracting opportunities for small businesses. OSBP maintains vigorous digital marketing engagement capabilities including its website, NASA Vendor Database, OSBP Mobile App, email marketing, social media presence, and an online calendar. These tools allow OSBP to engage directly and effectively with small businesses and execute virtual small business outreach events.   As always, this achievement is credited to the support of NASA's Executive Senior management, the Agency's small business professionals, technical and program teams, and strong partnership with our acquisition professionals."},

DHS not only provides increased opportunities for small businesses to include women-owned, service-disabled veteran-owned, HUBZone, small disadvantaged, and 8(a) firms but sets a benchmark for excellence in government procurement.  In FY 2023 DHS obligated $9.9 billion (the highest amount in Department history) to small businesses, $800 million more than in FY 2022. This fiscal year also marks the second time that DHS has met all ten small business goals (prime and subcontracting). In addition, the Department's ability to exceed its increased small disadvantaged business goal of 17.9% with an achievement of 18.01% is a testament to the Department’s commitment of partnering with small businesses and underserved communities.

U.S. Department of the Treasury is pleased to earn an improved score of an A on the FY23 scorecard. In FY23, Treasury obligated $3.7 billion in prime contract dollars to small businesses, for a 7% increase over FY22 obligations. Treasury’s commitment to providing opportunities for small disadvantaged businesses resulted in FY23 obligations of $1.2 billion to SDBs, for a remarkable 27% increase over FY22. In FY 2023, Treasury exceeded its Women Owned Small Business goal of 5% to 9.4%, awarding over $940 million to Women Owned Small Businesses, an increase of $346 million over FY 2022; exceeded its Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business goal of 3% to 4.21%, awarding over $428 million to SDVOSB, an increase of $103 million over FY 2022; and exceeded its HubZone Business goal of 3% to 3.71%, awarding over $377 million to HUBZone. In FY 2023, Treasury added 46 new small businesses to the supplier base in FY23, including 29 SDBs and 5 SDVOSBs. These achievements reflect our continued commitment to advancing equity in procurement, and could not have occurred without the exceptional effort of Treasury’s acquisition workforce and the support of Treasury leaders. In FY24, we will strive to increase our obligations to small businesses in all categories to meet the increased socio-economic category goals set by the SBA and continue to attract new entrants to Treasury procurement."},

Fiscal Year (FY) 2023, EPA continued its collective efforts to expand contracting opportunities for small and socioeconomic businesses. Overall, EPA awarded a record amount of $1.1 billion to small businesses. This represents a $117 million increase from EPA’s prior year high of small business dollars. Additionally, although EPA did not achieve the Agency’s small disadvantaged business (SDB) goal of 17.8%, EPA succeeded in increasing its SDB spend by $127 million, representing a 3.7% increase from the Agency’s SDB goal achievements in FY 2022. Also, as compared to the previous FY, EPA increased both the dollars and percent of total contract spend awarded to women-owned small businesses and certified HUBZone businesses. Looking ahead, EPA remains steadfast in its commitment to increase the utilization of socioeconomic businesses in EPA acquisitions. This includes early acquisition planning to tailor data-driven procurement strategies, targeted small and socioeconomic vendor engagement and outreach, and effective acquisition training on proven practices for expanding socioeconomic business contracting opportunities."},

U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is honored to receive an annual procurement scorecard rating of \"A+\", the highest grade available from the Small Business Administration (SBA). The recognition represents significant accomplishments made by HUD to create contracting opportunities for small business concerns in all categories. For FY 2023, HUD exceeded its small business annual prime goal and all socio-economic goals --- Small Disadvantaged, Women-Owned, Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned, and HUBZone. This achievement was due to the collaborative efforts of the program offices, procurement and OSDBU staff, and the Department's senior leadership. To support the government-wide priority on advancing equity in federal procurement and expanding opportunities for Small Disadvantaged Businesses (SDBs), HUD convened a series of outreach events for SDBs helping them to navigate the complex federal marketplace.  Additionally, HUD conducted outreach events to help new and recent entrants access capital, understand Multi-Agency Contracts (MACs) and Government-Wide Acquisition Contracts (GWACs), market to government agencies, and better understand the Department’s cybersecurity requirements and needs. HUD also continued convening its signature annual Information Technology (IT) Industry Day and outreach events for women-owned, HUBZone, and Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned small businesses.  Also, noteworthy, HUD launched its inaugural outreach series with Historically Black Colleges and Universities providing resources for small businesses.  These critical advocacy efforts build the pipeline of small businesses in the industrial base which has significantly declined over the past decade. HUD also remains committed to continually focusing its acquisition workforce and clients on changes in acquisition policies and regulations that impact small business utilization and programs. With its robust acquisition planning processes, the Department will continue to identify areas to maximize practicable opportunities for small businesses in contracting and advance procurement equity."},

U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is fully committed to supporting its mission and operations through Federal acquisitions with small businesses and achieving its small business goals. The agency's Small Business Program has implemented an active compliance, technical assistance, and outreach program designed to maximize prime and subcontract opportunities for small businesses.    The NRC Small Business Program continued to improve the comprehensive support it provides to agency buyers as well as increase its engagement with the small business marketplace. As a result, the agency exceeded four out of five of its small business prime contract goals, missing its small disadvantaged business (SDB) goal by approximately one percent, a goal which was increased by 458 percent over the past two fiscal years  and raised to a historically high level (one of the highest SDB goals in the Federal Government). However, the agency more than doubled the goal for women, service-disabled veterans, and companies located in historically underutilized business zones. The interdependency and collaboration among the Small Business Program and the agency’s Acquisition Management Division on acquisition planning and market research activities was critical to NRC's achievements.   Moving forward, the Small Business Program aims to continue making progress towards maximizing opportunities for small businesses by removing barriers to conducting business with the Federal Government through a variety of strategic activities. Such efforts include designing additional resources that aid businesses in identifying and responding to NRC acquisition opportunities, continuing the popular virtual small business events and a launching spinoff series designed to assist new entrants navigate the NRC procurement process, and leveraging innovative practices that improve the evaluation of marketplace capabilities."},
